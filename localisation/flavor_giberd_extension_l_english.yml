 flavor_giberd_ext.1.t:0 "Found the Giberdi Company"
 flavor_giberd_ext.1.d:0 "With the foundation of the Giberdi Hierarchy, the upper echelons of the government have been discussing the need for more specialized troops in our military. Despite the near-unanimous agreement on this point, two factions soon were at odds with each other on this issue. One side argued that such specialization should be left to the state's military, as they have already demonstrated their ability to train specialized units. The other faction felt that the state should leverage the expertise of experienced an mercenary company, reducing the amount of training required at a reasonable expense. After weeks of arguing without progress, they have appealed directly to you for a final decision.\n\nThe State's Faction presented the long list of accolades among the state's military leadership. The Free Trade Faction presented three accomplished mercenary leaders, each with unique specializations."

 flavor_giberd_ext.2.d:0 "In reforming our nation into the Giberdi Hierarchy, discussions on the functions of society naturally drifted to religion. Following the Dragonwake, our people have drifted from our ancestors' atheism. It has offered many benefits, to be sure, but many Giberdi intellectuals have begun suggesting that it has held back the Hierarchy in recent years. With the declaration of the Giberdi Hierarchy and with the strength to act free from foreign influence, we may seek to revisit our official religion during this transition.\nDo we maintain the status quo? Or do we turn to the teachings of our ancestors to grow to new heights?"
 flavor_giberd_ext.2.a:0 "No, we are sure of our decision."

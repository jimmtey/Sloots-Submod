The soldiers couldn't understand what he said, but he took a long drag from a wooden pipe before offering it to them enthusiastically.  One of the soldiers accepted the offer, taking a puff and quickly coughing up what little smoke he inhaled before passing it to his compatriots.  After they each followed suit, a smile slowly spread across their faces as their eyes turned red.
